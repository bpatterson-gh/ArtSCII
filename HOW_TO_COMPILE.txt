Linux:

1. Install the OpenCL SDK - https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-SDK

2. Install mono-complete - https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin

3. Build artscii's C library using compile.sh (in the C folder) or equivalent terminal commands
    If using compile.sh, make sure to rename references to /usr/include and /usr/lib so they point to your OpenCL headers/libraries from step 1

4. Build ArtSCII.exe by using Mono's xbuild tool:
    xbuild /property:Configuration=Nix-Release /property:Platform=x64 CSharp/ArtSCII/ArtSCII.csproj

    Available configurations are Nix-Debug and Nix-Release

5. If you want a native binary, you can run the following command to generate one:
    mkbundle -o artscii --simple ArtSCII.exe --machine-config /etc/mono/4.5/machine.config --config /etc/mono/mconfig/config.xml

    You can uninstall Mono and the native binary will still function. You must keep Cairo installed, though.


Windows:

1. Install the OpenCL SDK - https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-SDK

2. Install Mono 64-bit (No GTK#) and Mono Gtk# - https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-win

3. Install MSYS2 - https://www.msys2.org/
    After installing and updating packages as shown on the website, install Cairo with pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cairo

4. Add the directory containing libcairo-2.dll to the PATH environment variable
    The default is C:\msys64\mingw64\bin

5. Build artscii's C library using compile.bat (in the C folder) or equivalent terminal commands
    If using compile.bat, make sure to rename references to C:\include and C:\lib so they point to your OpenCL headers/libraries from step 1

6. Build ArtSCII.exe with CSharp/ArtSCII.sln or by using Mono's xbuild tool:
    xbuild /property:Configuration=Win-Release /property:Platform=x64 CSharp/ArtSCII/ArtSCII.csproj

    Available configurations are Win-Debug and Win-Release

7. [Optional] Bundle all DLLs and ArtSCII.exe into the same folder, so it can be used without MSYS2
    The following MSYS2 libraries are dependencies:
     libbrotlicommon.dll
     libbrotlidec.dll
     libbz2-1.dll
     libcairo-2.dll
     libexpat-1.dll
     libfontconfig-1.dll
     libfreetype-6.dll
     libgcc_s_seh-1.dll
     libglib-2.0-0.dll
     libgraphite2.dll
     libharfbuzz-0.dll
     libiconv-2.dll
     libintl-8.dll
     libpcre-1.dll
     libpixman-1-0.dll
     libpng16-16.dll
     libstdc++-6.dll
     libwinpthread-1.dll
     zlib1.dll
